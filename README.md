# console-synth

This is a synthesizer that uses the keyboard home keys to play around with. There's a lot of
code in there to play with - but not much in the way of a UI. 

You'll have to build this yourself in Visual Studio or a gnu compiler if you can manage it.

Not much more development planned for this right now; but I'm probably going to just port this
to a Raspberry Pi or an Arduino to play with to create a real-time synth computer that can be
used with a midi controller (like a cheap keyboard).
